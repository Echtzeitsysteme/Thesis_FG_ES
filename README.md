# Student Thesis

This folder contains the template for student theses at the Real-Time Systems Lab. **Before you use this template, please make sure that all packages of your TeX installation are up to date.** Most distributions include GUI tools to do this (e.g., TeX Live Utility for TeX Live and MacTeX). Among others, updating all packages avoids using outdated version of the TUDa package.

If you still encounter problems with this template, a possible solution might be to uninstall TeX und reinstall the latest release of TeX (updating an installed TeX version is sometimes not sufficient as not all of the components are updated with this method). After having (re-)installed the latest TeX release, please also update the installed packages. This is necessary as TeX releases are usually updated only once a year.

Unfortunately, providing the official logo in this repository is forbidden due to copyright reasons.
Thus, the file *tuda_logo.pdf* only acts as a placeholder and has to be replaced manually.
**Please download the official logo from [here](https://download.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/protected/CE/TUDa_LaTeX/tuda_logo.pdf) and overwrite the placeholder file *tuda_logo.pdf* with the official logo.**

If you only submit the thesis digitally (without an additional submission of a printed version), please replace \\affidavit by \\affidavit\[digital\] in the file thesis-main.tex. Therewith, the affidavit is adapted accordingly.

Additionally, this template must be compiled with LuaLaTeX (which is part of most TeX distributions) to generate a PDF/A conforming file. The usage of pdfLaTeX should also be possible but the result is not PDF/A conforming. **PDF/A conformance is required for uploads to TUbama!**

This template is a slightly adapted version of the template available at [GitHub](https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates), [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tuda-ci), and [TU Darmstadt](https://www.ce.tu-darmstadt.de/ce/latex_tuda/index.de.jsp).
